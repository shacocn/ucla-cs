transform every upper case letter to lower case
remove from collection if 
	word contains no characters
	word contains character that is not a letter
	separation is negative
	same w1 and w2 values
		remove the one with lesser separation value
return number of patterns (treat negative nPatterns as 0)

for loop going from 0 to nPatterns
	check if there are character issues
	check for same w1 or w2 values
		convert to lower case
