All the methods are implemented and should be working as expected!

//////////
// BIG-O
//////////
All methods in the Trie class have the right Big-O.
All methods in the Genome class have the right Big-O.
All methods in the GenomeMatcher class should also have the right Big-O.

find():
check that first character matches and return if not
repeatedly:
    if key is empty string or the node is nullptr, return
    otherwise,
      if the char does not match
          return if mismatch already occurred or exactMatchOnly is true
      if it's the end of the word, add to results and return
          check for the next match in each of the node's children

findGenomesWithThisDNA():
find all potential matches within the Trie
for each match:
    extract the rest of the fragment 
    record whether or not first segment already had a mismatch
    for each char in rest of fragment:
        if first char does not match
          move onto next potential match if exactMatchOnly is true or already mismatch
        increase length count
    if valid word, create new DNAMatch and add it to the vector
